## Course Description

Quarter 1 of the capstone covers two parallel topics:
1. The basics of “data science methodology” for a large project,
   including best practices for data handling and project
   reproducibility ("lecture").
2. Beginning research into your choice of domain. Acquaintance with a
   domain is made via replicating a specified result in a your domain
   of inquiry ("discussion"). 
   
The Q1 Project will result in (2) will use the best
practices learned in (1). This work then serves as a foundation for
project proposals due at the end of the quarter. The projects will be
worked on, in groups, in the second quarter. While the methodology
portion is taught in a traditional lecture setting, most of the
material covered in this course will be done through *self-guided*
learning: readings, data exploration, and ensuing discussion.

Data Scientists typically work on projects in groups. As such, large
assignments throughout the sequence (the replication; project
proposal; project itself) are worked on in groups. Like in a career or
research situation, these groups will be formed using a variety of
factors, including academic background, mutual interests, and a little
randomness.

## Course Components

### Lecture (data science methodology)

One hour per week will be devoted to lecture on data science
methodology. There will be accompanying light homework assignments.

### Discussion (domain)

Two hours per week will be devoted to discussion about domain specific
topics (1hr in section; 1hr in office hours); you must attend the
section for your choice of domain. Discussion will involve discussion
about readings and assignments, so it is imperative that you complete
the relevant assignments *before attending discussion section*. Each
section begins with a set of questions to which you will write a
response; your response will serve to drive the class discussion. **If
you do not ask questions in discussion section, no discussion will
occur.** Domains are run by mentors, not instructors; you must
actively participate in discussion.

### Remark on how the course is split

As is common in Data Science, you will likely find yourself as a
bridge between domain specialists and (computing) methodology
specialists. In the case of this course, it is expected and normal
that discussion section leaders will not know specifics of your code
(or even know the language you are coding in!). You will have both (1)
office hours with a methodology expert and (2) office hours and
discussion with domain experts. As such, it is up to you to formulate
your questions for the appropriate audience (domain expert or
computing expert), so that you can adequately communicate with them to
solve the problem you are facing.

## Assessments and Grades

The course grade will be computed using the following proportions:

|Component|% of Grade|
|---|---|
|Methodology HW|5%|
|Discussion Section Participation (Mentor)|5%|
|Discussion Section Particicpation (Written Responses)|5%|
|Domain Q1 Project (reports + checkpoint)|50%|
|Domain Q1 Project (code)|20%|
|Project proposal|15%|

### Grading Policy

Implementing a consistent grading scheme for work in such a diverse
collection of areas is helped by both a clear rubric and a coarse
grading scheme.

* Each assignment will have a (generally applicable) grading rubric
  that will help guide your grading. 
* Each assignment will be graded using a coarse schema that reflects
  broad checkpoints that students met. This schema helps maintain
  focus on *large, impactful* things that students can improve on and
  should reduce grading disaggreements.
  
The grading scheme for assignments in the course are given on an
A/B/C/F scale (without plus/minus). Generally, these grades reflect
the following criteria (credit: Shannon Ellis),

|Grade|Criteria|
|---|---|
|A (4.0) |Accomplishes the task accurately, completely, and clearly. Code is clear, effective, and efficient. Written component is concise, at the appropriate level, and correct. Oral component (when applicable) is effective both visually and explanation; is within the time limit. |
|B (3.0) |Accomplishes the task well, but lacks some completeness or clarity. Code runs but lacks some aspect of clarity, effectiveness, and or efficiency. Written component is logical and generally correct, but lacks either clarity or accuracy. Oral component (when applicable) is moderately effective and/or slightly outside the time window. |
|C (2.0) |The task is somewhat accomplished, but lacks significantly when it comes to completeness and clarity. Code present but does not accomplish the task up to the standards of a data science graduating senior. Written component lacks substantial clarity/correctness. Oral component (when applicable) significantly lacks effectiveness/clarity. |
|F (0.0) |The task largely remains unaccomplished. Code lacks completeness, structure, and is unclear. Written component lacking required information to understand what you did and/or your results. Oral component (when applicable) is nonsensical/unclear. |


Final grades will be computed using the grade-points above, using the
proportions given in the course components table. Letter grades will
be assigned using the standard university cutoffs.


## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard and engage with material that
originates outside the academic walls. All ideas and work must be your
own, that of your approved group, or properly cited. Act with
integrity and don't cheat.

In DSC 180 you are encouraged to use outside resources to help with
your work. However, **you must properly cite any concepts, writing, or
code** that originates from other sources. If you are unsure of
whether something needs a citation, it's best to:
* consult the domain expert for your section, and
* follow the examples in course readings.
* place code citations with the relevant link in comments.

The following activities are considered cheating and ARE NOT ALLOWED
in DSC 180 (this is not an exhaustive list):

* Using or submitting either writing or code acquired from other
  students (except your partner, where allowed).
* Not properly citing ideas, writing, or code acquired from outside
  sources. (Citations are a good thing!)
* Having any other student complete any part of an assignment on your
  behalf.
* Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and
ARE ALLOWED in DSC 180:

* Discussing the general approach to understanding or solving a problem.
* Talking about debugging/cleaning strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them.
* Using outside material with proper citations (including
StackOverflow code!).
