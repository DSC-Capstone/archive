## Q1 Project


The Q1 project is the main output of the first quarter
work. The final result consists of a report and code replicating a
known result in your domain (chosen by your domain mentor) or a
preliminary investigation into a problem in the domain. Doing a
careful job on this assignment will:
* Give you a broad overview of your domain, alongside a nuanced
  understanding of a small area within your domain. This will
  familiarize you with the way the field approaches questions and the
  data that's used to approach them.
* Serve as an initial codebase for your own Quarter 2 project.
* Serve as practice for writing your Quarter 2 (and as a rough draft of
  your background/literature review).
  
Quality work on the Q1 project *will* drastically reduce the
work you do on the Quarter 2 project -- building off of a thorough
result replication will allow your own project to more developed,
nuanced, and sophisticated!

## Project Proposal

*This assignment is worked on in your project group of 2-4*.

The [project proposal](/assignments/quarter-1-project-proposal):
* details the problem you will investigate in Quarter 2, 
* lays out the initial plan for investigation, 
* gives a verbal 'elevator pitch' describing the relevance of the
  proposal.
  
The proposal will motivated with due diligence and data-driven
conclusions, much like a business or grant proposal.

## Methodology Assignments

The [methodology assignments](/assignments/quarter-1-methodology)
are weekly assignments that guide you through Data Science project
basics that will be useful as you work in your chosen
domain. Generally, these assignments have you apply a new tool or
concept to your specific domain problem. These assignments roughly
parallel lecture topics and fall into the following categories:
* Software Development for Data Science Projects
* Best Practices for Compute Environments
* Effective Scientific Communication

## Participation

Each week, at least 24 hours prior to meeting with your domain, [submit
material for discussion](/assignments/quarter-1-participation) on
Canvas. This submission serves the following purposes:
* It serves as a regular self-evaluation tool and place to gather your
  thoughts, so that you can address difficulties in a timely
  manner. The precision reqired of doing this in writing holds your
  critical assessment of your understanding to a higher bar.
* It allows your domain mentor to structure discussion *ahead* of
  time, if they so choose.

**Note**: As every domain is different, your mentor may choose to have
you answer different questions than the one below. This assignment is
merely a *default* assignment. However, you should always be turning
something in.
