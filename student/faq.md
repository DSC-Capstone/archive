### How do I know what projects will look in a domain?

The domains listed at the bottom of the page vary in specificity;
different mentors may have different visions for how much flexibility
those in their domain have in determining their project.

When you choose an employer after graduation, the precise nature of
your work will be unknown, and may change depending on the
circumstances. Generally, your choice depend on your compatibility
with the *general* area in question. Take the same perspective here;
you won't know precisely the topuc, only the general area. If
you would like to know more about a specific area, look up the
mentor's research page or take a look at previous Capstone project ehy
have mentored (if any).

### What should I consider when deciding on a domain (subject-matter)?

When considering domains of study, you should consider:
 - Whether you prefer a class focused on methods, systems, or an
   applied domain
 - Whether any specialized knowledge will be highly leveraged in the
   domain. While all domains are open to all students who meet the
   prerequisites, the process of "getting-up to speed" in the domain
   during quarter-1 will require more work if you have no exposure
   to the specialized knowledge.
   
Beyond that, really *all* domains cover interesting questions that
offer a great opportunity for two quarters of research!

### What if I can't sign up for my prefered domain?

Being a Data Scientist requires getting up to speed in an area you may
not know and bringing your quantitative skillset. Really, any of
these areas are quite interesting, once you get into the problem!
Please be open-minded about your area of choice!

Furthermore, not everyone realized that the problems that may seem
mundane are often more interesting, more realistic to 'real-world'
problems a data scientist might tackle, and yield more interesting
results. A project on a trendy topic runs the risk of coming across
like a cursory data science blog, as oppossed to the mature project
this has the potential to be.

### What should I consider when choosing a domain (mentor)?

When considering potential domain mentors, be aware that they will
be acting in very different capacities than a course
instructor. Here are a few points to consider:
 - The biggest factor in a successful project is personalized
   attention and a small class. You should prefer to enroll in
   domains with smaller enrollment, even if the you think you might
   like a different mentor/subject more.
 - The skillset required for mentoring relies more on expertise in
   an area and less on the track-record of an course
   instructor.
 - You mentor may be a source of letters of recommendation in the
   future. As such, research faculty leading small sections give you
   the best opportunity for future opportunities!
