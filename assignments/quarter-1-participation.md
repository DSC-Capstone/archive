Each week, at least 24 hours prior to meeting with your domain, submit
material for discussion on Canvas. This submission serves the
following purposes:
* It serves as a regular self-evaluation tool and place to gather your
  thoughts, so that you can address difficulties in a timely
  manner. The precision reqired of doing this in writing holds your
  critical assessment of your understanding to a higher bar.
* It allows your domain mentor to structure discussion *ahead* of
  time, if they so choose.

**Note**: As every domain is different, your mentor may choose to have
you answer different questions than the one below. This assignment is
merely a *default* assignment. However, you should always be turning
something in (with the exception of the first, when your mentor may
not have assigned you any readings or tasks).

Please turn in answers to the following questions to Canvas. You may
choose to answer any combination of 1,2,3 from below, as long as you
answer one of each.

If you were primarily assigned *reading* for the week, answer these
three questions:
1. Describe one thing you found interesting in the reading. Describe
   what it is in your own words and why you found it interesting.
2. Describe one thing that you found difficult to understand. Try to
   be specific about what you don't think you understand. 
3. In the reading, identify one *choice* that the author made in their
   investigation and your best guess at why they made that
   choice. For example, this may be a choice in sub-population to
   study, or a choice in parameter for a model.

If you were primarily assigned *a task* for the week, answer these
three questions:
1. Describe one result you found interesting doing your task. Describe
   what it is in your own words and why you found it interesting.
2. Describe one thing your struggled with doing your task. Try to
   be specific about what is causing you difficulty and why. 
3. In your work, identify one *choice* that you made in your
   investigation. Why did you make this choice? Were there other
   choices you could've made that would be reasonable? For example,
   this may be a choice in sub-population to study, or a choice in
   parameter for a model.
