This assignment is due 24 hours before your domain meeting.

Each week before discussion section, your group should meet to discuss
your progress. Each group should turn the following progress report in
to Canvas:

* What did each group member do the previous week? Did it meet the
  goals set out in the schedule? Were there unexpected obstacles? Do
  you need help overcoming them? *Be sure you explicitly list what
  each group member did that week!*
* What will each group member do next week? Are any of these tasks new
  and/or unexpected? 
* Are there any changes to the project proposal that have to be made?
* Include an updated schedule with any changes.

Every group member should be informed about the status of the tasks of
all other group members. In section, one member will be chosen to give
an update for their group. You should use the oppurtunity in section
to discuss any difficulty/changes with your mentor and the rest of the
domain.
