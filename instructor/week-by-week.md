Each week describes what students are being assigned in other portions
of the course, especially when it relates to the domains in some way.

## Week 1

* Students learn that domain's meet in discussion section once/week,
  that they must do the readings/tasks for the domain *ahead* of
  meeting, and come prepared to discuss the reading.
* Students must turn in a 'participation' assignment every week, 24hrs
  before section meets. Mentors don't need to create their own
  assignments (unless they want to). See
  [here](/assignments/quarter-1-participation).
* Students are required to access and understand the basics of the
  [DSMLP Cluster](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/resources/computing/). 
  The cluster has a shared volume with separate storage for each
  domain. They will be expected to use a combination of local and
  remote development in this course.
* Domain mentors who wish to use the cluster (and/or store data there)
  can use a course account (each domain has their own). Contact course
  staff for access.

## Week 2

* Students are required to create a project code template for the Quarter 1
  project, according to guidance from lecture.
* Mentors are suggested to discuss the main problem statement for the
  domain and make it clear what their 'Q1 project' will
  consist of (either, a replicating a specific paper, or a clear
  topic/roadmap for their own preliminary investigation into a topic).

## Week 3

* Students will learn 'the anatomy of a scientific paper' to help them
  structure the first few sections of their paper (e.g. introduction,
  methods).
* Students should be getting their hands dirty as this point, either
  writing code, working through material by hand, or both.
  
## Week 4

* Students will turn in **checkpoint 1** of their Q1 Project
  assignment at the end of week 5 - this consists of writing an
  'introduction' (problem statement,
  background, and description of either the data or basic methods). You may
  want to assign them the task of writing a rough draft that you can
  discuss in class.
* Students learn about containerizing compute environments with
  Docker. They will be asked to create a starter container for their
  domain.
  
## Week 5

* Students learn about project software development and how to write
  flexible/generic code for changing investigations
  (i.e. 'parameterizing hypotheses'). They should be thinking about
  different parameters in their project that should be kept in
  configuration.
* Students turn in the **checkpoint** of their [Q1
  Project](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/assignments/quarter-1-replication/)
  at the end of the week.
  
## Week 6

* Students learn about how to write an informative description of data
  for their papers that supports the given investigation. For methods
  based domains, students will focus on describing the types of data
  sources for which the method is appropriate.

## Week 7

* In discussion, you may want to have students discuss potential
  projects for their Q2 Capstone project. 
* Students should form groups of 2-3 by the end of the week.
* Students will learn how to run long-running jobs on the DSMLP
  cluster using Kubernetes.

## Week 8

* Have students present/discuss a rough draft of their project
  proposal in section..
* In lecture, students learn the anatomy of an effective elevator
  pitch and turn in an outline for their project.

## Week 9

* Final Q2 Capstone Project proposal due.

## Week 10

* Have students Elevator Pitches given in discussion.
* Replication project due.
